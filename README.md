# PokeDokeMart

PokeDokeMart is an ecommerce PokeMart where you can buy items, view orders, leave reviews, and upload your Pokemon team for personalized item suggestions. It was made as my final fullstack project for Nashville Software School. The tech stack consists of React.js, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and PostgreSQL.
